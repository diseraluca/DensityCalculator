# DensityCalculator

A coding test I've done for a company.

The test simulates a machine which has two sensors, running at different frequencies, that collect samples of data ( position of the sensors and the density of an examined, abstract, object ) and an external examiner that asks to query the collected data.

While the test did not require to be completed with this level of detail, it was a much interesting example of a learning experience that allowed me to prioritize some subjects ( namely, the basis of c++ concurrency ) that I was interested in for quite some time.

Unfortunately, due to a much too busy life, I could spend a small amount of time on it and the test is to be considered incomplete and lacks in both structure and execution ( so much that there is a lack of synchronization that leads to a data race ).
